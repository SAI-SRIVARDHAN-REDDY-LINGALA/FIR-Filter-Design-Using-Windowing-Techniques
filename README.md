# **FIR Filter Design Using Windowing Techniques**

---

## üìñ Project Overview

This project focuses on **designing and analyzing Finite Impulse Response (FIR) low-pass filters** using various **windowing techniques** in MATLAB. It demonstrates:

* Why **FIR filters** are preferred for practical implementation over ideal Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters.
* How **discrete-time signals** are used in computers to approximate continuous signals.
* Effects of different **window functions** (Rectangular, Triangular, Hanning, Hamming, Blackman) on filter performance.
* **Time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics** of filtered signals.
* Noise suppression and **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement**.

The project blends **theory and simulation**, showing the **practical trade-offs** in filter design.

## üî¨ Theoretical Background

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Why FIR Filters?

* **Ideal IIR filters** have infinite duration and sharp cut-offs, making them **non-causal and impossible to implement** in real-time systems.
* **FIR filters** have **finite impulse responses**, are inherently stable, and can achieve linear phase.
* **Windowing** is applied to approximate the infinite ideal response:

$$
h(n) = h_d(n) \cdot w(n)
$$

where $h_d(n)$ is the ideal impulse response and $w(n)$ is the window function.

* This method **reduces the Gibbs phenomenon**, which appears as oscillations in the stopband when truncating the ideal response.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Why Discrete Instead of Continuous?

* Computers **cannot handle continuous-time signals**, so signals are **sampled** and processed digitally.
* Discrete representation allows **FFT computation**, **filtering**, and **simulation**.
* Discretization introduces **sampling artifacts**, which must obey the **Nyquist criterion** to avoid aliasing.
* FIR filters operate on **discrete signals**, making them ideal for digital processing.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Window Functions and Their Effects

| Window          | Characteristics               | Time-domain Effect                      | Frequency-domain Effect                            | Best For                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rectangular** | Abrupt truncation             | Strong oscillations in impulse response | Narrow main lobe, very high side lobes             | Simple FIR filters, low N                               |
| **Triangular**  | Linear tapering               | Reduced ripples                         | Moderate main lobe width, lower side lobes         | Moderate stopband requirements                          |
| **Hanning**     | Cosine taper, smooth          | Gradual edges                           | Ripple envelope decreases linearly                 | Smooth filtering, audio                                 |
| **Hamming**     | Cosine taper, constant ripple | Similar to Hanning                      | Constant ripple envelope, slightly wider main lobe | Audio, communications                                   |
| **Blackman**    | Strong taper                  | Smoothest response                      | Wide main lobe, very low side lobes                | High stopband attenuation, noise-sensitive applications |

* **Trade-off:** Narrow main lobe ‚Üí better frequency resolution, low side lobe ‚Üí better stopband attenuation. Choice depends on **application needs**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Signal Filtering & Noise Handling

* Input signals often contain multiple frequencies:

$$
x[n] = \sin(\pi/8 \cdot n) + 2\sin(\pi/2 \cdot n)
$$

* FIR filters remove undesired high-frequency components.
* Filtering noisy signals shows **SNR improvement**, calculated as:



#### Input SNR
The input SNR measures the signal quality **before filtering**:

$$
\[
\mathbf{SNR_{in}} = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{\text{Power of clean signal}}{\text{Power of noise}} \right) 
= 10 \log_{10} \frac{\sum x[n]^2}{\sum \text{noise}[n]^2}
\]
$$

#### Output SNR
The output SNR measures the signal quality **after filtering**, indicating the effectiveness of noise suppression:

**Key Points:**
* **SNR\(_{in}\)** ‚Äì Higher values indicate less noise in the input signal.
* **SNR\(_{out}\)** ‚Äì Higher values indicate better noise reduction by the filter.
* Comparing SNR\(_{in}\) and SNR\(_{out}\) allows evaluation of **filter performance** across different window types (Rectangular, Triangular, Hanning, Hamming, Blackman).

$$
\[
\mathbf{SNR_{out}} = 10 \cdot \log_{10} \left( \frac{\text{Power of filtered signal}}{\text{Power of residual noise}} \right) 
= 10 \log_{10} \frac{\sum y[n]^2}{\sum \left( y_\text{noisy}[n] - y[n] \right)^2 }
\]
$$

* Observations reveal **window effectiveness in noise suppression**.
